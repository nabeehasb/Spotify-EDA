# Spotify Music Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of Spotify songs to explore various audio features such as acousticness, danceability, energy, and more.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of key audio features

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh

   ```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis:
```sh
jupyter notebook Untitled.ipynb
```

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following key features:
- `acousticness`: Confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic.
- `danceability`: Suitability of a track for dancing.
- `energy`: Perceptual measure of intensity and activity.
- `tempo`: The overall estimated tempo in beats per minute (BPM).
- `song_title`: The name of the song.
